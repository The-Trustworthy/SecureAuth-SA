## Quick Overview 💨  
> * Submitted for [NetScout Cyberathon](https://www.starhacks.org/apr2022-netscout-cyberathon)  
> * Won 2nd prize in advance level of challenges   
> * 24hrs. collective effort by _CyberKnight_ - a team of 4 members  

## Requirements 🧩  
Today’s Internet has been twisted and contorted to use authentication and session management, essentially breaking both. The most common authentication attack uses a proxy-based attack tool (`BurpSuite`’s Intruder, for example) to brute force the login credentials of a legitimate user.  

## What's crazy about SA? 🤯  
**SecureAuth** implements a multi-level data encryption mechanism where we have smartly used both symmetric as well as asymmetric cryptography. It aims to utilize the core cryptographic methods like working with Hexadecimal velues & XOR operation as well as the advance algorithms including `AES` based cipher block chaining _(CBC)_ data encryption and hashing using `SHA-256`. It also has dynamic effective password generation quality for any two identical passwords of different users.  

### Key Features ✨  
1. Novel, innovative and Research oriented  
2. Multi-level data encryption  
3. Utilizing a set of well proven and accepted algorithms like `SHA-256` and `AES`  
4. Modular, easy to implement and integrate
